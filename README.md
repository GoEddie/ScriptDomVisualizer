# ScriptDomVisualizer

HELLO! If you have come here looking for the script dom visualizer, I am sorry but it is no longer available to download.

I am creating a package of awesome dacpac/DacFX related tools - when it is read I will put a link here.

In the meantime if you can't do without it then please feel free to contact me directly (don't bother creating an issue here I don't monitor it).

Best Regards,


Ed
